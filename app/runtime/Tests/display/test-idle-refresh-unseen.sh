# A window out of sight keeps the slow refresh tick
# (omacvm-cocoa-idle-refresh-unseen.patch), checked in the patched ui/cocoa.m:
#   - cocoa_gl_refresh tells the tick about a frame only when the window can
#     show it, and asks for no present while it cannot;
#   - "cannot show it" is present-unseen's test: the occlusion state and
#     OMACVM_PRESENT_HIDDEN, on the IOSurface present path only;
#   - the frame is still drawn when the window shows again (present_bh);
#   - with --self-test (CI): the checks fail on the code before the patch.
