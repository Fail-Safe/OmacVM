# Lossless-compressed present surfaces (omacvm-cocoa-present-lossless.patch): the patched ui/cocoa.m makes
# its 8-bit surfaces as '&BGA' and its half-float ones (HDR, Extra brightness) as '&RhA' through CoreVideo,
# falls back to plain surfaces of that kind for the run when one cannot be made or bound, gives the layer
# EDR for both half-float kinds, makes half float lossless only where that was checked on screen (HDR, Extra
# brightness, both with the layer's EDR; a 10-bit scanout without HDR or OMACVM_GL_COLOR=native stays plain), never makes 10-bit 'l10r' surfaces, reads OMACVM_GL_LOSSLESS and never reads a present surface on the CPU.
# glReadPixels from one (it crashes on a compressed one) happens only in the partial present's check mode
# (OMACVM_GL_PRESENT_DAMAGE=check), which keeps the surfaces plain. Without an argument: only that the checks catch the code
# without it (CI); GL drawing into such a surface is checked on the Mac by work/window-path/lbcheck.m (a GPU).
