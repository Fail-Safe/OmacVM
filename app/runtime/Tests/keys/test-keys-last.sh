# QEMU's full-grab tap and keyboard sharing apps (#350,
# omacvm-cocoa-keys-last.patch): with OMACVM_KEYS_LAST=1 (OmacVM.app's hidden
# shareKeyboard) the tap goes at the end of macOS's event tap chain, so a
# keyboard sharing app (Synergy, Deskflow, ...) sees the keys first; without
# it at the head, as before. omacvm_keys_place() runs in test-keys-last.c.
#   test-keys-last.sh                       (CI: the function from the patch)
#   test-keys-last.sh <patched ui/cocoa.m>  (the runtime build: also the wiring)
